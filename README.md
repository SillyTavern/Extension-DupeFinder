# Duplicate Finder

Adds an ability to cluster characters by similarity groups to easily find duplicates.

## How to use

1. Install the extension using a built-in installer.
2. Find a new button in the character list view, left to a search bar. A modal window will open after you click it.
3. There you can adjust the similarity threshold - the higher the number, the more "similar" the character cards should be to get grouped together.
4. Click "Calculate" to run the search. This may take some time, especially on large character libraries.
5. If any of the character clusters match the search criteria, they will be displayed in a list. You can click the "View" button to open a chosen character.

## Prerequisites

SillyTavern - latest `staging` version preferred, or stable release >= 1.11.7.

This *won't* work on any older versions.

## What fields are evaluated in the search?

To conserve time, only the V1 character card fields are getting checked:

* Name
* Description
* First message
* Personality
* Scenario
* Examples of dialogue

## Why the heck it takes so long?

The algorithm finds similar characters using the Levenshtein distance between every character pair.
This means that the complexity of the search grows quadratically with the number of items in the list.

For example, for 200 characters, the program needs to do 200Â² = 40000 comparisons.
For 10000 characters that would be 100 million operations, etc.

TL;DR be patient.
